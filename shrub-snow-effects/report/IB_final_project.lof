The figure relates canopy transmittance (the ratio of intensity of a single beam leaving the canopy to its intensity entering) to solar zenith angle $\theta _s$. The "No scattering" curves refer to the baseline model proposed by Mahat and Tarboton, which is purely an implementation of Beer's Law.\relax }}{7}{figure.caption.3}

The parameters used for these model runs are representative of late-May/early-June conditions on the Seward Peninsula at 65N, except for the mean insolation.
