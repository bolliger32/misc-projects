Title:
NCEP Reanalysis Vapor Pressure

Description:
Gridded daily time step data from Ohio State University based on NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data, interpolated from the NCEP/NCAR grids
(~209km) (http://www.ncep.noaa.gov/) to the 25km Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid using a bi-lagrange interpolation formula.
As part of the data processing of ArcticRIMS (http://RIMS.unh.edu) based at the Water Systems Analysis Group, University of New Hampshire
all data sets have been aggregated to multiple temporal and spatial resolutions.

Classification:
Hydrology, Climate
